                        <p>Temperature quantifies the warmth or coldness of the atmosphere and surroundings. Temperature is a fundamental component of weather, influencing a wide range of weather conditions and phenomena: </p>
                        <p>
                               
                                <ul>
                                        <li> Cold and Warm Fronts: The interaction of cold and warm air masses, each with different temperatures, leads to the formation of weather fronts. These fronts can bring changes in weather, including precipitation and temperature shifts.</li>
                                        <li>Precipitation Type: Temperature plays a critical role in determining whether precipitation falls as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Freezing temperatures can lead to wintry precipitation.</li>
                                        <li>Humidity: Temperature affects the air's moisture-holding capacity. Warm air can hold more moisture, while cooler air has a lower capacity. Temperature and humidity together influence the likelihood of rain, thunderstorms, or snowfall.</li>
                                        <li>Temperature Inversions: In certain weather conditions, the temperature profile of the atmosphere may invert, resulting in temperature increasing with altitude. These inversions can trap pollutants near the ground and impact air quality.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>

                               <p> Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air, typically expressed as a percentage. It represents the air's moisture content and its capacity to hold water vapor.
                                <br>
                                Relative Humidity: Relative humidity is a common measure of humidity. It compares the amount of water vapor in the air to the maximum amount the air could hold at that temperature. It is expressed as a percentage. Higher relative humidity means the air is closer to saturation, while lower relative humidity indicates drier conditions.
                                <ul>
                                        <li><b>Heat Index:</b> In hot and humid conditions, the heat index or "feels like" temperature can be significantly higher than the actual air temperature.</li>
                                        <li><b>Dew Point:</b> The dew point temperature is the temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture, leading to dew formation or potential fog. </li>
                                        <li><b>Precipitation Formation:</b> High humidity levels are a prerequisite for the formation of rain, snow, or other forms of precipitation. Low humidity can lead to dry weather.</li>
                                        <li><b>Comfort and Health: </b>High humidity can make hot weather feel more uncomfortable, while low humidity can lead to dry skin, respiratory discomfort, and an increased risk of dehydration.</li>

                                        Moisture refers to the presence of water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere. It plays a crucial role in weather patterns, affecting humidity levels, cloud formation, and precipitation, while also influencing temperature regulation and the occurrence of severe weather events.

                                        <ul>
                                                <li>Humidity's Temperature Impact: High humidity makes air feel warmer, while low humidity can make it cooler. Warm, moist air can lead to cloud formation and precipitation.</li>
                                                <li>Precipitation Source: Moisture is a key factor in various types of precipitation, like rain and snow. Rising, cooling, and saturated air release moisture as precipitation.</li>
                                                <li> Temperature Stabilizer: Moisture regulates temperature due to water's heat capacity. Bodies of water temper climate by slowly absorbing and releasing heat.</li>
                                                <li>Fog Generator: When air cools to its dew point, saturated moisture forms ground-level fog, impacting visibility and activities.</li>
