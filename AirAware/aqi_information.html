It provides a numerical value and color-coded scale to inform the public about air pollution levels and their potential health impacts. The AQI serves as a vital tool in promoting air quality awareness and public health.

                                        <ul type="none">Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10): Tiny particles or droplets in the air that can be inhaled into the lungs. PM2.5 refers to particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller, while PM10 includes larger particles up to 10 micrometers in diameter.
                                        </ul>
                                        <ul>Ground-Level Ozone (O3): A secondary pollutant formed by chemical reactions between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the presence of sunlight.</ul>
                                        <ul>Carbon Monoxide (CO): A colorless, odorless gas produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.</ul>
                                        <ul>Sulfur Dioxide (SO2): A gas primarily emitted from the burning of sulfur-containing fuels, such as coal and oil.</ul>
                                        <ul>Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2): A reddish-brown gas produced by combustion processes, particularly in vehicles and industrial facilities. </ul>

                               <p>The AQI provides a simple and easy-to-understand way to convey the level of air pollution to the public. It is calculated using a sub-index for each of the primary pollutants mentioned above, and then the maximum sub-index value is selected to represent the overall AQI value for a given location. The process involves the following steps:</p>
                        <li>
                                <ul>1. Calculate Sub-Indices: The concentration of each primary pollutant is transformed into a sub-index, indicating the level of air quality associated with that pollutant. These sub-indices are calculated using specific equations.</ul>
                                <ul>2. Select the Maximum Sub-Index: The highest sub-index value among all the primary pollutants is chosen as the overall AQI value for that location.</ul>
                                <ul>3. Color-Coding: The AQI value is associated with a specific color code, ranging from "Good" (green) to "Hazardous" (maroon), to make it easier for the public to interpret.</ul>
