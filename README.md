# AirAware üåè

## Project Overview

**AirAware** is a web-based platform designed to help individuals, particularly those with respiratory conditions, make informed decisions about the air quality in different locations across India. By entering their respiratory condition and desired location, users can receive personalized advice on whether it is safe to visit based on the AQI (Air Quality Index) values. Additionally, AirAware features an interactive map and detailed pollutant information to provide comprehensive insights into air quality. The data is fetched from official government sources.
